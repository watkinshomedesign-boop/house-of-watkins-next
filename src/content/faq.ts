        question: "Q: Are your plans ready to submit for permitting?",
        answer:
          "A: Our plans include everything needed to build your home, but building codes and permitting requirements vary by region. Before applying for a permit or starting construction, always check with your local building official to confirm exactly what’s required. We’re here to help clarify what your local authority wants, and we’re happy to talk you through the process.",
      },
      {
        question: "Q: Do the house plans include engineering?",
        answer:
          "A: Engineering is region-specific; our plans don’t include structural engineering because requirements are different everywhere (due to soil, weather, etc.). Most areas require a local engineer to review and stamp plans. If you need, we can help you find a local engineer — free of charge.",

        question: "Q: Can I customize house plans? Is there a limit on revisions?",
        answer:
          "A: Absolutely. Most clients want some modifications — sometimes small, sometimes major. We include up to five rounds of revisions in the customization process (though most clients need far fewer). After that, we’re happy to keep working at an hourly rate with a separate agreement if you’d like.",

        question: "Q: How long does it take to get modified plans?",

        question: "Q: Can I request modifications after I purchase a plan?",

        question: "Q: Why shouldn’t I just buy a cheap plan online?",
        answer:
          "A: It’s tempting, but most bargain plans are missing crucial details and support. The hidden cost? Expensive mid-project changes, confusion, and stress. With us, you get a designer who cares about your success — not just a download link.",
