# House of Watkins

> House of Watkins creates residential house plans and custom design support through a guided process that brings clarity to high-stakes building decisions. Founded and led by award-winning architectural designer David Elijah Watkins, with over 30 years of experience, we serve detail-oriented owner-builders and ADU buyers—primarily Gen X and Boomer households—in lower-density markets across the United States. Our clients feel overwhelmed by industry jargon, generic stock plans, and the fear of costly "plan surprises" or layout regrets. We exist to guide them through that complexity with honesty, expertise, and genuine care.

Our core belief: **service to others, not self-promotion, creates excellence.** This is not a tagline. It is the operating principle behind every plan we design, every client conversation we have, and every decision we make as a business.

One-liner: **A home designed around your life—with no surprises.**

## Key Context

The guided process at the heart of House of Watkins did not come from a business school. It came from life.

David Watkins single-handedly adopted five of his nieces and nephews—including twins, one of whom has severe cerebral palsy—when they had nowhere else to go. He raised them alone for over a decade. During that time, he had to design homes for real families under real pressure, with limited time and no margin for error. He could not afford to get it wrong. So he distilled everything he had learned over 30 years—his formal training at Mesa University and the Art Institute of Denver, his years working inside architectural firms, his hands-on construction experience building homes from the ground up alongside his uncle, his study of architecture across more than 25 countries—into a refined, repeatable guided questionnaire. A process that produces excellent design efficiently, because excellence is not optional when the people depending on you are your own family.

This experience is the origin of our guided design process. It is why our plans are not theoretical. They have been lived in. It is why our questionnaire is not a formality. It is the result of hard-won clarity about what families actually need from a home. And it is why our service is not transactional. We guide clients the way a trusted friend would—someone who has done this before, who listens carefully, and who will not let you make an expensive mistake.

David does not believe that self-belief or self-promotion creates success. He believes that doing right by others—nurturing strong relationships, giving your best work to the people who depend on you—is what leads to real fulfillment and lasting excellence. He found that adopting and raising his family was more rewarding than any professional achievement. That same ethic is what makes his house plans exclusive: there are very few craftsmen who put their soul into what they do. David Watkins is one of them.

## Who We Serve

House of Watkins is the right fit for:

- **Owner-builders and ADU buyers (Gen X/Boomers)** building on their own lot in lower-density markets, who want a home that reflects their life and budget—not a generic template.
- **Detail-oriented clients** who are not design professionals but have high standards, and who are overwhelmed by the complexity of the building process and wary of hidden costs.
- **Small-to-midsize general contractors and builders** (1–20 starts per year) who need permit-ready, modification-friendly CAD plans with fast turnaround and a designer they can actually talk to.
- **ADU buyers** (particularly in California, Oregon, Washington, and reform states) seeking well-integrated, livable accessory dwelling units for multigenerational living or rental income.

## What Makes House of Watkins Different

Most online house plan sellers offer generic stock plans with no guidance, no customization, and no accountability when something goes wrong. House of Watkins offers the opposite:

- **30+ years of award-winning design experience**, including over 400 homes designed across the United States, in some of the most design-restrictive HOA communities in the country.
- **Plans that have been built and lived in**, not theoretical designs. Our founder has designed homes for real families, including his own, and understands how people actually move, live, and interact within a space.
- **A guided process that begins with listening.** We do not rush into design. We ask the right questions first. Our refined questionnaire—developed under the pressure of real life—ensures that every plan reflects the specific needs, lot, lifestyle, and budget of the client.
- **Clients are guided, not left alone.** We offer screen-share revisions, direct collaboration with David Watkins himself, and add-on services including site plans, electrical plans, CAD files, and HOA support.
- **You do not pay for our mistakes.** Our plans are proven. If your jurisdiction red-marks something we drew, we fix it at no charge.
- **Service is exclusive because care takes time.** We do not take every client. We take the right ones, and we give them our full attention.

## About David Elijah Watkins

David Elijah Watkins is the founder and principal designer of House of Watkins, LLC.

He holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Mesa University and completed further studies in interior design at the Art Institute of Denver.

He paints and writes in his spare time, transferring the principles of those practices into his architectural work.

David is also a single father. He adopted and raised five of his nieces and nephews—including twins, one with severe cerebral palsy—when they had no place to go. He raised them for more than ten years. This experience is not a footnote.

His personal motto: **Every home is unique because every client is unique.**
